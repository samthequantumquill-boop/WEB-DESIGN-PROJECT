# WEB-DESIGN-PROJECT
A clean, responsive, and accessible pricing table built using semantic HTML and modern CSS. Perfect as a small project for your portfolio or as a component to drop into any website.
This repository contains a polished pricing-table component implemented with plain HTML and CSS (no frameworks). It demonstrates layout techniques (Flexbox / CSS Grid), responsive design, hover and active states, simple CSS animations, and attention to accessibility.
Use this component to showcase subscription tiers (Free / Pro / Enterprise), feature comparisons, and call-to-action buttons.
Features:-
1.Responsive layout (mobile-first) that looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops.
2.Clear visual hierarchy for plan names, prices, features, and CTAs.
3.Highlighted recommended plan ("Most popular" badge) and subtle hover emphasis.
4.Accessible markup: semantic elements, keyboard-focus styles, and ARIA where appropriate.
5.Easy-to-customize variables (colors, spacing, fonts) using CSS custom properties.
6.Lightweight — no JavaScript required for core functionality.
